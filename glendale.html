            <h3>Fun Fact:</h3>
            <p>Why is this city named Glendale? No one knows. It's origin is an English boy’s name meaning “wooded valley” or “glen”.. yet Glendale when settled and established, was just an empty desert. W.J. Murphy, the builder of the Arizona Canal in 1883-1885,
                referred to the area as “Glendale” when sold to pay off debts on the canal. He would call the area "their Glendale Castle" in love letters to his wife. But the reason behind choosing this name remains a mystery to this day.</p>
